# Development Backlog & Roadmap

## Phase 1: Basic functionable boostrap
- Implement all in single main file, just enough for them to have their basic working functions, no shiny things (OTA, foldering, etc)

## Phase 2: Structuring
- Refactor with targetted internal file structure, decompose & compose with dependency injection in mind

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
- TBD
